# History
Attdef is the most popular SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) Attack and Defend Gamemode. The Attack and Defend Game type (Referred to as A/D) is based on A/D rumble initially by Boylett, mabako, and other [NB] Clan Members back in 2006. A/D has subsequently gone under the rule of many different gametypes including:

* World Cup A/D
* Deadly Combinations (Used in Competitive A/D played through the Electronic Sports League).
* Battlegrounds A/D
* Warhead A/D
* Wargrounds
* WarZone
* Most recently, Bulletproof
* many many others.

A/D Gametypes have even been ported into VC:MP, IV:MP and MTA:SA. It is the most popular gametype for competitive GTA Multiplayer from the III era.

Many of these gametypes have died off over the years, however, attdef has a unique property about it. It is still dominating A/D servers and has been for 5 years! Currently, attdef has run on over 1,000 servers and still manages many clans clanwars due to its stability, performance and unique style.

# What is A/D?
A/D is a gametype where two teams fight over a single checkpoint somewhere on GTA's map, each fighting arena is referred to as a base. Bases are designed with all GTA's weapons in mind to create an environment where every weapon has a chance to compete and an important roll in the game. 

## Teams
Teams are split into **Attackers** and **Defenders**. Attackers can win the game by doing one of the following:

* Eliminate all defending players
* Capture the bases checkpoint. To capture the checkpoint you must stand in it for a predetermined number of seconds, (usually around 20).

Defenders can win the game by:

* Eliminating all attacking players
* Waiting for the round timer to hit 0. (Usually set to around 8 minutes, though it has changed over the years).

## Details
Attackers spawn some distance away from the checkpoint and are allowed to spawn vehicles to attack the base however they feel necessary. There are a great number of ways to attack a base successfully. Defenders are not allowed to spawn cars but must defend from the attackers taking a predetermined checkpoint

## Weapon Selection
Two weapons are normally chosen by each player on the team. Sometimes these weapons come in sets and sometimes you get to chose them individually depending upon how the gamemode is configured.

## Health
All players spawn with 200 hp (100 health, and 100 armor). Players have one life in the round, and once they have been killed they will be put into a spectator mode until the end of the round.
